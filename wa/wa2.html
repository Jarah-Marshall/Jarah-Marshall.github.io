    <h2> Hello! My name is Jarah Marshall(he/him/his)</h2>

    <p>I'm from Centennial, CO, and I'm currently a 4th year transfer student pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science,
    with a Minor in Creative Technological Design. When I'm not in class or doing homework, I enjoy listening to music, 
    playing different games with my friends, and cooking! </p> 
    
    <p>My dream career is Game Development, video games have had a positive impact on my life and I would love to
    create games that can have the same affect on other people.</p>

    <p>My goals for this course are to improve my Web Development skills, have fun making/editing different websites, 
    and to learn more about HTML,CSS,and JScript! I'm excited for this class and can't wait to learn!</p>

    <strong> One of my favorite youtube channels is the Babish Culinary Universe, he recently did a video titled 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHfUQd4Ki-0"><i>Can Babish Beat NYC's Best Pizza? (Blind Taste Test)</i></a> which was a fun watch!</strong>
