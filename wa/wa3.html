        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Jazz</strong> is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, 
            Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues, ragtime, European harmony, 
            African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, 
            it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized 
            by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to 
            different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, 
            biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical 
            tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz 
            (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the 
            prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging 
            "musician's music" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed 
            near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues 
            to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, 
            or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without 
            regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz 
            improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a 
            commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles 
            and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.

        <h3>Etymology and Definition:</h3>
        <p>
            The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. 
            It is believed to be related to jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning 'pep, energy'.[3][4] The 
            earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in which a minor league 
            baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a 'jazz ball' "because it wobbles and you simply can't 
            do anything with it".
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune. 
            Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916, Times-Picayune article 
            about "jas bands". In an interview with National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections 
            of the slang connotations of the term, saying: "When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't 
            called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front 
            of ladies." The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th Century.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from 
            ragtime to rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical 
            traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its 
            terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a "form of art music which originated 
            in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music" and arguing that it differs from 
            European music in that jazz has a "special relationship to time defined as 'swing'". Jazz involves "a spontaneity and 
            vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role" and contains a "sonority and manner of phrasing which 
            mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician".
        </p>

        <p>
            A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: "it is music that includes 
            qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', and being open to different musical 
            possibilities". Krin Gibbard argued that "jazz is a construct" which designates "a number of musics with enough in common 
            to be understood as part of a coherent tradition". Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, "It's all music."

        <h3>Elements:</h3>
        <h4>Improvisation:</h4>
            <p>
                Although jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it contains many subgenres, improvisation is one of 
                its defining elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such 
                as blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African-American slaves 
                on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early 
                blues was also improvisational. Classical music performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, 
                with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to 
                play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and 
                collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer. 
                The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the 
                performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, 
                harmonies, and time signatures.
            </p>

            <p>
                In early Dixieland, a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising countermelodies. 
                In the swing era of the 1920s-40s, big bands relied more on arrangements which were written or learned by ear and 
                memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the bebop era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small 
                groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the piece was 
                improvised. Modal jazz abandoned chord progressions to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, 
                a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. 
                The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the composition structure and complement the soloist. 
                In avant-garde and free jazz, the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, 
                for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.
            </p>
            <h4>Traditionalism:</h4>
            <p>
                Since the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been 
                criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a "tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art 
                form". Regarding the Dixieland jazz revival of the 1940s, Black musicians rejected it as being shallow nostalgia 
                entertainment for white audiences. On the other hand, traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free 
                jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An alternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform 
                diverse musical styles. By avoiding the creation of norms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.

        <h3>Diversity in Jazz:</h3>

        <h4>Jazz and Race:</h4>
        <p>
            For some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to African-American contributions to culture and history. For others, 
            jazz is a reminder of "an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions". Amiri Baraka argues 
            that there is a "white jazz" genre that expresses whiteness. White jazz musicians appeared in the Midwest and in other 
            areas throughout the U.S. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was called "the father of 
            white jazz". The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix 
            Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the 1920s. The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians 
            such as Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa 
            became leading members of swing during the 1930s. Many bands included both Black and white musicians. These musicians helped change 
            attitudes toward race in the U.S.
        </p>

        <h4>Roles of Women:</h4>
        <p>
            Female jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz throughout its history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, 
            Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O'Day, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters were recognized for 
            their vocal talent, less familiar were bandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, 
            trumpeter Valaida Snow, and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the 
            early 1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano.
        </p>

        <p>
            When male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II, many all-female bands replaced them. The International Sweethearts 
            of Rhythm, which was founded in 1937, was a popular band that became the first all-female integrated band in the U.S. and 
            the first to travel with the USO, touring Europe in 1945. Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald 
            Wilson. Beginning in the 1950s, many women jazz instrumentalists were prominent, some sustaining long careers. Some of the 
            most distinctive improvisers, composers, and bandleaders in jazz have been women. Trombonist Melba Liston is acknowledged 
            as the first female horn player to work in major bands and to make a real impact on jazz, not only as a musician but also as a 
            respected composer and arranger, particularly through her collaborations with Randy Weston from the late 1950s into the 1990s.
        </p>
        <h4>Jews in Jazz: </h4>
        <p>
            Jewish Americans played a significant role in jazz. As jazz spread, it developed to encompass many different cultures, and the work 
            of Jewish composers in Tin Pan Alley helped shape the many different sounds that jazz came to incorporate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jewish Americans were able to thrive in Jazz because of the probationary whiteness that they were allotted at the time.
             George Bornstein wrote that African Americans were sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish American and vice versa. 
             As disenfranchised minorities themselves, Jewish composers of popular music saw themselves as natural allies with African 
             Americans.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Jazz Singer with Al Jolson is one example of how Jewish Americans were able to bring jazz, music that African Americans 
            developed, into popular culture. Benny Goodman was a vital Jewish American to the progression of Jazz. Goodman was the 
            leader of a racially integrated band named King of Swing. His jazz concert in the Carnegie Hall in 1938 was the first ever 
            to be played there. The concert was described by Bruce Eder as "the single most important jazz or popular music concert in 
            history".
        </p>

        <p>
            Shep Fields also helped to popularize "Sweet" Jazz music through his appearances and big band remote broadcasts from such 
            landmark venues as Chicago's Palmer House, Broadway's Paramount Theater and the Starlight Roof at the famed Waldorf-Astoria 
            Hotel. He entertained audiences with a light elegant musical style which remained popular with audiences for nearly three 
            decades from the 1930s until the late 1950s.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="EarlyDevelopment">
        <h3>Early Development </h3>
        <p>
            Jazz originated in the late-19th to early-20th century. It developed out of many forms of music, including blues, ragtime, 
            European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. It also 
            incorporated interpretations of American and European classical music, entwined with African and slave folk songs and the 
            influences of West African culture. Its composition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each 
            performer's personal interpretation and improvisation, which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre.
        </p>
        <h4>Afro-Cuban influence</h4>
        <p>
            African-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 19th century when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) 
            gained international popularity. Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between both 
            cities to perform, and the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City. John Storm Roberts states 
            that the musical genre habanera "reached the U.S. twenty years before the first rag was published." For the more than 
            quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent 
            part of African-American popular music.
        </p>
        <p>
            Habaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically based on an African 
            motif (1803). From the perspective of African-American music, the "habanera rhythm" (also known as "congo"), "tango-congo", 
            or tango. can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.[68] The habanera was the first of many Cuban 
            music genres which enjoyed periods of popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo-based rhythms in African-American music.
        </p>
        <p>
            New Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk's piano piece "Ojos Criollos (Danse Cubaine)" (1860) was influenced by the composer's 
            studies in Cuba: the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand. In Gottschalk's symphonic work "A Night in the Tropics" (1859), 
            the tresillo variant cinquillo appears extensively.[69] The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans "clavé", 
            a Spanish word meaning "code" or "key", as in the key to a puzzle, or mystery. Although the pattern is only half a clave, 
            Marsalis makes the point that the single-celled figure is the guide-pattern of New Orleans music. Jelly Roll Morton called 
            the rhythmic figure the Spanish tinge and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz.
